# SD2799_Software-Development-Capstone
This is all of the work I've done for the Capstone project for the Software Development Program at ITT Tech.

## Description
This repository houses a bootstrap example and javascript code examples for the AWS Document Client API.
The end goal is to create a toolkit from which others can build their own work, much like jQuery.
